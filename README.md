clone the repo and run ```pip install pygame``` in the cmd. Then open a terminal in the project folder and write ```python SpaceShooters.py``` to run the game.
### Note: **Must have Python3 installed**

# How To Play The Game!
You start with 5 lives and move the bigger spaceship and shoot at others, for each spaceship that reaches the bottom of the screen you lose one of your 5 lives.
When the smaller spaceships hits you with their lasers or they bump/collide into you, Your health decreases and you cannon regen when you lose a life, You just lose the game.
The game restarts when you lose. So always keep shooting!
